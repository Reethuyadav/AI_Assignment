1st Answer:
Yes, AI can definitely play games, including HTML5 games like the ones on K4 Games! This is super cool and can be done using concepts from computer vision and machine learning.

Using Computer Vision:

Image Recognition: AI can "see" what's happening in the game by recognizing different elements on the screen, like characters, obstacles, and rewards.
Object Detection: It can detect specific objects or characters, helping it make decisions about what to do next.
Optical Flow: By tracking the movement of objects across the screen, AI can predict what's going to happen next and react in real time.
Segmentation: This helps AI understand different parts of the screen, like where it's safe to move and where it might get into trouble.
Tools to Use:

OpenCV: This is a super powerful library for computer vision. It helps with things like image recognition and object detection.
TensorFlow/Keras: These are great for training neural networks to recognize images and objects.
Reinforcement Learning Libraries: Libraries like OpenAI Gym can create environments where AI can learn by playing games.
Selenium: For HTML5
